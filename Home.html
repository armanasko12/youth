<h1>Askole</h1> 
<img src="K2.jpg" alt="k2" width="100%">
<p> Askole, is a small town located in Braldo Shigar, in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan. Askole is in a remote region
     of the  Karakoram mountains 3040 meters above sea level. It is notable for being the final settlement before one enters 
     the wilderness of the high Karakorum’s.
    Askole is the gateway to four of the world's 14 highest peaks known as Eight-thousanders (above 8,000m), and is the launchpad 
    for mountaineering expeditions to K2, Broad Peak and other major mountains.
    Geographically Askole is big tourist place in the world. Yearly about 6 to 7 thousands tourist are visit here. Despite being
     such an important tourist destination Askole is the most of Backward and remote region of Pakistan and totally neglected by
      the authorities and deprived from the necessities of life i.e., Road, Education, Health, and light and forced to live in
       extreme poverty and miserable life. The literacy rate of this valley is 2.5% the people of this valley used to farm and
        pottering Tourist is only financial resource.

<h3>Askole Braldo Road</h3>
<p>The Askole Braldo Valley Road is a very steep zig-zag trail located in the Skardu District of Gilgit Baltistan in northeastern Pakistan.
    Located in the upper Braldu valley, the road is really challenging and a true test of your vehicle and your stamina because the road abounds in twists and turns with wheels sometimes hanging above the precipice. The road runs through the Braldu Gorge to Askole and Korphe, two small villages. Askole is the last settlement of Shigar district, and from there, mountaineers begin their campaign to scale K2, the second-highest mountain on Earth, and Broad Peak (K3). Drive with care as this is a mountain road with hairpin curves and dangerous drop-offs.
    Take a tip from the tortoise: slow and steady wins the race. 
    The road runs along the banks of the Braldu River. It is in dreadful condition and requires strong nerves to negotiate it. It’s certainly breathtaking and it has a fearsome reputation. Once within the sheer valley of the Braldu, it is necessary to cross the river several times by wooden suspension bridges. The condition of the bridges is hair raising. The area is the source of some extraordinary aquamarine and topaz specimens, mostly on feldspar. 
    It remains an adrenaline-pumping journey and is not for the faint of lungs, heart, or legs. Words can’t describe the road and pictures don’t do it justice. The most challenging and exciting part of the journey is passing through the narrow and winding Braldu gorge, which is surrounded by dangerous peaks. This road is used by mountaineers approaching the north face of K2. At the Braldu Gorge, the road is carved out to Askole. It’s blasted out of the rocks next to the roaring Braldu River. The narrow gravel road sometimes slants dangerously towards the Braldu River. 
    This precarious dirt road passes through remote areas.  There is no cell phone coverage in the area. The road squeezes by the fast-flowing river, passing an exposed pegmatite so closely that it can be easily touched from inside the vehicle.

<h3>Health and Light</h3>
<p>Electricity is a rare thing in this area. It comes from a maximum of 2 hour per day. 1,000 villagers in 90 homes have been without electricity since January 2019. The nearby hydropower plant broke down due to too much snow melt caused by climate change. Victorian-era lighting solutions like kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas currently being used are expensive and dangerous 
The health system is also very bad, which is indescribable. In case of emergency, it is necessary to take the city. But due to the bad condition of the road, many deaths occur.

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>
    <i> Education is a matter of life and death for any nation.</i> But I am not talking for Universities colleges High school but there is not even a good primary school in this valley even this era. There is no money for education in other cities. Therefore, the student of this valley is forced to work in his teen. Therefore, this area is always declining instead of developing.
    The village school has 400 students, 280 boys and 120 girls divided into 8 classes forced to share 5 classrooms. There are currently 8 teachers; 3 are paid for by the government, 2 are paid for by the community and 3 are volunteers. 
    The kids’ enthusiasm to learn, like all children in the remote areas of Pakistan, is overwhelming! The facilities at the school, however, are woefully inadequate
    The problems in this area are such that I should mention which issues should be left to whom.
    I think all these problem in overcome only by education.
